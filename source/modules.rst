Modules
========
Modules are a simple way to structure a program. Mostly, there are modules in the standard library and there are other Python files, or directories containing Python files, in the current directory (each of which constitute a module).
You can also instruct Python to search other directories for modules by placing their paths in the PYTHONPATH environment variable.
